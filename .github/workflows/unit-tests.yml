  # The vitest 4.0.x test coverage integration doesn't support Node 18,
  # Node 18 has reached EOL already, however for compatibility we're still going to run tests
  # for Node 18 until the next major release (see https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-js/pull/256).
  # Run coverage only once on a modern node to generate a report to avoid downgrading vitest.
